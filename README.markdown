#### Vehicle Maintenance Records in GIT

Small record-keeping system to keep track of vehicle maintenance tasks in GIT, written in markdown. Easily commit changes to track scheduled maintenance, cost and mileage.

Maintenance table looks like this:

| Mileage       | Maintenance    | Cost    | Date  |
| :------------ |:-------------: | :-----: | ----: |
| xxxxxx        |                | $1600   |       |
| xxxxxx        |                |   $12   |       |
| xxxxxx        |                |    $1   |       |
